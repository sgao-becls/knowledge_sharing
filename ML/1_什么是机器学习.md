## 什么是机器学习

- [ ] 定义, 来自Tom Mitchell
  - [ ] A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, 
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
  - [ ] 下棋: E是多次下棋积累的经验, T是下棋这个事情, P代表击败对手的概率

- [ ] 算法参数调优是现阶段比较重要的, 而不是算法本身的改进
  - [ ] 举例: 木匠
